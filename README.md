# CxState Router

Due to the fact that a URL together with a browsers history API represent it's own state machine, there's no sense in synchronizing this state into another state machine. However what makes sense is to equalize the APIs for route-definition, -querying and -changing. That's what this router does: Providing a familiar API that is very much like the one of CxState: strongly typed and concise.
